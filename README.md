Currently only one project (BePind You) but I anticipate more in the future.

BePind You:
A project built with the ultrasonic range sensor Raspberry Pi module that notifies the user via LED when someone is close behind them. Programmed in C, the notifications vary for different distance circumstances.

The code can be seen in distSensor.c and there will be gifs/pictures to follow this repo soon.
